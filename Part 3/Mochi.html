  <h3>Mochi</h3>
  <p>Mochi ice cream is a modern variation of traditional Japanese mochi, which consists of small balls of ice cream wrapped in a layer of sweet, chewy mochi dough. The mochi dough is made from glutinous rice flour, sugar, and water, which is kneaded into a smooth, pliable dough and then wrapped around a small ball of ice cream.</p>
  <p>Mochi ice cream comes in a variety of flavors, such as green tea, strawberry, chocolate, and mango. It is often served as a dessert or snack, and can be found in many Asian grocery stores and Japanese restaurants around the world. The combination of the cold ice cream and the soft, chewy mochi dough makes for a unique and satisfying texture and taste experience.</p>

  <p>Ice cream is a frozen dessert that is made from a mixture of milk, cream, sugar, and flavorings. The mixture is churned in an ice cream machine to incorporate air and create a smooth and creamy texture. Ice cream can be made in many different flavors, such as vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, and mint chocolate chip, and can also include a variety of mix-ins, such as fruit, nuts, and candy.</p>
